# PFMCal

The present software is an update of the previously published MatLab
code for the calibration of optical tweezers in the high-resolution detection
of the Brownian motion of non-spherical probes [1]. In this instance, an
alternative version of the original code, based on the same physical theory
[2], but focused on the automation of the calibration of measurements using
spherical probes, is outlined. The new added code is useful for high-frequency
microrheology studies, where the probe radius is known but the viscosity of
the surrounding fluid maybe not. This extended calibration methodology is
automatic, without the need of a user’s interface. A code for calibration by
means of thermal noise analysis [3] is also included; this is a method that
can be applied when using viscoelastic fluids if the trap stiffness is previously
estimated [4]. The new code can be executed in MatLab and using GNU
Octave.
